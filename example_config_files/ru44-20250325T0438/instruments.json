            "description": "A profiling CTD instrument designed specifically for installation on Slocum autonomous gliders. It measures conductivity, temperature and pressure for use in oceanic research, updating ocean models, assessing sensor stability on moored observatories, and leveraging data collection opportunities from operational vehicle missions. It outputs real-time data in decimal S/m, degC and decibars, or raw decimal counts. It is externally powered and continuously pumped, and can operate in both continuous sampling or polled sampling modes. It features an expendable anti-foulant device offering bio-fouling protection, and is supplied with Seasoft V2 Windows software for setup and data processing. The pressure sensor with temperature compensation is available in 4 strain-gauge ranges; 0-100; 100-350; 350-1000; 1000-2000 metres. It measures conductivity from 0-9 S/m at a resolution of 0.00001 S/m, temperature from -5 to +42 degC at a resolution of 0.001 degC, and pressure up to 2000 m (dependant on the range chosen), at a resolution of 0.002 percent of full scale range.",

Measurement based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers. The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. In this standard model, a black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water. This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight housing. The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured. For improved stability the 4831 optode also performs a reference phase reading by use of a red LED that does not produce fluorescence in the foil. This model is fitted with a standard sensing foil. By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined. Accuracy +/- 1.5% or 2uM; precision +/- 0.2 uM.",
