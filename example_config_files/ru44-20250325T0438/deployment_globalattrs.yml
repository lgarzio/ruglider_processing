comment: Deployed by Joe Rauch and team on a small boat out of Compostela, Cebu, Philippines with shoreside support from Jessica Leonard. Data from the CTD are suspect. Potential lag mostly visible in the salinity profiles. Please use with caution.

summary: The project supports the assessment and development of an open ocean seaweed farming demonstration facility near Cebu City, Philippines. The project will provide a framework for assessing the potential to increase carbon dioxide sequestration in the ocean. Assessing the seaweed farm potential will require the capability for assessing the biogeochemical impacts associated with the seaweed farm and the corresponding environmental footprint on the regional systems. The glider will be deployed in an ocean monitoring program to sample the oceanographic and ecological parameters, providing a baseline dataset to inform potential environmental impacts of seaweed farms. The goal is for sustained spatial sampling around the seaweed farm to map both the upstream and downstream conditions. The glider is equipped with a Seabird CTD, a WETLabs FLBBCD ECO puck configured for simultaneous chlorophyll fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter, and optical backscatter measurements, an Aanderaa Optode for measuring dissolved oxygen, and a Seabird SUNA for measuring nitrate concentrations.
